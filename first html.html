<p>My research studies how economic behavior and decision-making and business perception in daily life are affected by communication and visual elements and digital media. I study interactive media through an economics and business framework to analyze how design elements and messages and user experience impact business relationships with their customers. I view media as a strategic resource that provides marketing and branding and consumer engagement solutions instead of seeing it as an exclusive artistic expression. My research investigates how digital media and visual storytelling and interactive components shape modern technology-based markets to present and interpret information and drive user behavior. My work combines creative thinking with practical application because I use interactive media principles to create business communication methods that achieve better results and deeper impacts.
